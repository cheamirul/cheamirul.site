      <title>Eveng Network Simulator - GCP setup</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When learning networking for any reason, such as for professional certificates like CCNA or for upskilling, we cannot avoid using one of the popular tools, which is EVE-NG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first post about EVE-NG as I want to pursue the Cisco SCOR certification, and I find it more interesting to learn through labbing rather than just memorizing facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-eve-ng&#34;&gt;What is EVE-NG?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a software used for network simulation with various devices across vendors, as long as we have the image files needed for those devices. EVE-NG can be deployed using VirtualBox (Type 2 hypervisor), ESXi (Type 1 hypervisor), on bare metal servers, or on the cloud using providers that allow nested virtualization, such as GCP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Final Reflections on Email Security Before Taking Cisco SESA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous post, I shared how the basic flow of an email works before it reaches our inbox. Then, I introduced Ciscoâ€™s solution for email security, which is Cisco SEG, previously known as Cisco Secure Email Appliance (ESA). This post will also wrap up my current learning about Cisco ESA before I attempt the concentration exam in the CCNP Security track related to email security â€” the Cisco SESA exam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing the Cisco Secure Email Gateway (SEG/ESA): The Digital Gatekeeper</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-seg-solves&#34;&gt;The Problem SEG Solves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, email is one of the most targeted places for scammers and hackers to find their victims. Statistics from Cisco state that &lt;strong&gt;85% of email is spam&lt;/strong&gt;, containing various malicious content like malware, phishing, ransomware, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why email security is very crucial and vital in the enterprise email environment.&lt;br&gt;
Cisco Secure Email Gateway (SEG), previously known as Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), is an appliance designed as a front-line defense for enterprise email infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Under the Hood: How Your Emails Get Delivered</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-the-magic-of-instant-communication&#34;&gt;Introduction: The Magic of Instant Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, sending an email feels almost effortless. We sign up for an account with Gmail, ProtonMail or another provider type out a message, hit &amp;ldquo;Send&amp;rdquo; and within seconds it lands in someone else&amp;rsquo;s inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what actually happens after you click &amp;ldquo;Send&amp;rdquo; is much more complex. Thereâ€™s an entire system working behind the scenes to move your message across servers, networks, and protocols before it reaches its destination. Email doesnâ€™t travel the same way as regular web traffic and understanding how it works can be pretty fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
