[{"content":"The Problem SEG Solves Nowadays, email is one of the most targeted places for scammers and hackers to find their victims. Statistics from Cisco state that 85% of email is spam, containing various malicious content like malware, phishing, ransomware, etc.\nThat is why email security is very crucial and vital in the enterprise email environment.\nCisco Secure Email Gateway (SEG), previously known as Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), is an appliance designed as a front-line defense for enterprise email infrastructure.\nDiagram 1: Cisco SEG as Mail Gatekeeper What is Cisco SEG Cisco SEG is an appliance that can be deployed either on-premise or in the cloud. If it is on-prem, it can be a physical or virtual appliance. This appliance sits in the mail flow path and inspects both inbound and outbound email. In other words, it is a Digital Gatekeeper that inspects and filters email before reaching the mail server.\nEven if a company uses cloud email providers like Office 365 or Google Workspace, SEG can still be integrated to add advanced filtering and security layers.\nSEG Role in Email Flow During inbound mail flow, where most threats usually come from SEG scans every message. Depending on the result, it can drop, delay, or quarantine suspicious emails.\nMeanwhile, during outbound mail flow, SEG helps prevent sensitive data leaks. If employees accidentally (or intentionally) send confidential information, SEG applies policies to block or encrypt the message, helping companies stay compliant.\nSEG Key Components Here are a few key components inside Cisco SEG that make everything work:\nListener\nIt is the entry point for every email that SEG receives (both inbound \u0026amp; outbound). Listeners are always tied to interface IPs with port numbers (e.g., port 25, 587). SMTP Routes\nThis is how SEG decides which route to take to deliver the email. Think of it like a routing table in network devices. Mail Processing Pipeline\nThis is where and how all the email processing happens. This involves Mail Policies, Antivirus scanning, Spam filtering and other tasks. Each message passes through these stages before delivery. Why SEG is Still Relevant All enterprises need to follow certain compliances, especially in compliance-heavy sectors like healthcare and finance. That‚Äôs why SEG is still needed today.\nBesides that, hackers are always trying to find new ways to exploit vulnerabilities, so attacks are constantly evolving. Cisco SEG has its own internal research group, Cisco Talos, which provides threat intelligence to SEG when new attacks are discovered. This allows SEG to prevent new attacks early.\nAlso, SEG supports hybrid deployment, which fits most infrastructures, it can be on-prem, virtual or cloud-hosted by Cisco.\n","permalink":"https://cheamirul.site/posts/sesa-intro/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-problem-seg-solves\"\u003eThe Problem SEG Solves\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNowadays, email is one of the most targeted places for scammers and hackers to find their victims.

We sign up for an account with Gmail, ProtonMail or another provider type out a message, hit \u0026ldquo;Send\u0026rdquo; and within seconds it lands in someone else\u0026rsquo;s inbox.\nBut what actually happens after you click \u0026ldquo;Send\u0026rdquo; is much more complex. There‚Äôs an entire system working behind the scenes to move your message across servers, networks, and protocols before it reaches its destination. Email doesn‚Äôt travel the same way as regular web traffic and understanding how it works can be pretty fascinating.\nDiagram 1: Basic Mail flow Email Key Players Several components are involved in sending and receiving emails:\nEmail Client (MUA - Mail User Agent)\nExamples: Outlook, Thunderbird\nWhat it does: It let users compose, send, and receive emails. It connects to mail servers for sending (SMTP) and retrieving (IMAP/POP3) messages.\nMail Servers (The Post Offices \u0026amp; Mail Carriers)\nSMTP Server (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)\nRole: Sends emails to the recipient\u0026rsquo;s mail server. Think of it as the mail carrier.\nJob: Routes outgoing messages and receives incoming mail from other SMTP servers.\nPOP3/IMAP Server\nRole: Handles incoming messages for users.\nJob: Stores received mail and allows clients to fetch or sync messages.\nDNS (Domain Name System ‚Äì The Address Book)\nRole: Translates domain names into IP addresses.\nJob: Helps the sending SMTP server find the recipient‚Äôs mail server by querying DNS MX (Mail Exchange) records.\nDiagram 2: DNS Query The Journey: How an Email Is Sent (Step-by-Step) You hit \u0026ldquo;Send\u0026rdquo; in your email client (MUA)\nYour email client connects to the configured outgoing SMTP server. SMTP server processes the message\nThe SMTP server receives the email. It performs a DNS lookup to find the MX record for the recipient\u0026rsquo;s domain. Server-to-server communication begins (SMTP protocol)\nThe sender‚Äôs SMTP server connects to the recipient‚Äôs SMTP server (usually on port 25). They communicate using SMTP protocol, negotiating delivery. The message is transferred to the recipient‚Äôs server. Recipient‚Äôs server receives and stores the email\nThe email may be checked for spam, malware, or policy violations. If everything is okay, the email is accepted and stored on the server. The Journey: How an Email Is Received (Step-by-Step) Recipient opens their email client\nThe client is configured to connect to a POP3 or IMAP server. Email is fetched\nThe email client connects and authenticates. The mail is then downloaded (POP3) or synced (IMAP). The user can now read the message. Conclusion: More Than Just Magic This basic mail flow doesn\u0026rsquo;t even include security appliances like Cisco Secure Email Gateway (SEG) which are critical in real-world scenarios. Standard email protocols are vulnerable to threats such as phishing, spoofing, and malware.\nUnderstanding how email works under the hood helps explain why security tools like Cisco SEG (formerly ESA) are still important today. Despite being a decades-old technology, email continues to evolve‚Äîand so must our understanding and protection of it.\n","permalink":"https://cheamirul.site/posts/emailbegin/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction-the-magic-of-instant-communication\"\u003eIntroduction: The Magic of Instant Communication\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, sending an email feels almost effortless.
