      <description>&lt;p&gt;When learning networking for any reason, such as for professional certificates like CCNA or for upskilling, we cannot avoid using one of the popular tools, which is EVE-NG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first post about EVE-NG as I want to pursue the Cisco SCOR certification, and I find it more interesting to learn through labbing rather than just memorizing facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-eve-ng&#34;&gt;What is EVE-NG?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a software used for network simulation with various devices across vendors, as long as we have the image files needed for those devices. EVE-NG can be deployed using VirtualBox (Type 2 hypervisor), ESXi (Type 1 hypervisor), on bare metal servers, or on the cloud using providers that allow nested virtualization, such as GCP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Final Reflections on Email Security Before Taking Cisco SESA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous post, I shared how the basic flow of an email works before it reaches our inbox. Then, I introduced Cisco’s solution for email security, which is Cisco SEG, previously known as Cisco Secure Email Appliance (ESA). This post will also wrap up my current learning about Cisco ESA before I attempt the concentration exam in the CCNP Security track related to email security — the Cisco SESA exam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing the Cisco Secure Email Gateway (SEG/ESA): The Digital Gatekeeper</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-seg-solves&#34;&gt;The Problem SEG Solves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, email is one of the most targeted places for scammers and hackers to find their victims. Statistics from Cisco state that &lt;strong&gt;85% of email is spam&lt;/strong&gt;, containing various malicious content like malware, phishing, ransomware, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why email security is very crucial and vital in the enterprise email environment.&lt;br&gt;
Cisco Secure Email Gateway (SEG), previously known as Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), is an appliance designed as a front-line defense for enterprise email infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Under the Hood: How Your Emails Get Delivered</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-the-magic-of-instant-communication&#34;&gt;Introduction: The Magic of Instant Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, sending an email feels almost effortless. We sign up for an account with Gmail, ProtonMail or another provider type out a message, hit &amp;ldquo;Send&amp;rdquo; and within seconds it lands in someone else&amp;rsquo;s inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what actually happens after you click &amp;ldquo;Send&amp;rdquo; is much more complex. There’s an entire system working behind the scenes to move your message across servers, networks, and protocols before it reaches its destination. Email doesn’t travel the same way as regular web traffic and understanding how it works can be pretty fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
